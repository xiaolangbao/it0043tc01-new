                            <p class="full-content" style="display: none;"> Hello, as you already know, my name is
                                Robbie Raine Ferrer. Since you're already here, let me tell you about my self.
                                I am 19 years old, 1st year college student and currently studying in FEU Institute and
                                Technology. I aspire to be a Cybersecurity Analyst, and that is the main reason why I
                                chose this course.
                                at first, I thought I'll take Computer Engineer as my course, but ever since i watched
                                the Mr. Robot series, it change my mind. Now let's talk about my interests or hobbies,
                                for most of the time, i just watch
                                movies and series, ever since i was a kid, I am charmed by the movies, the quality of
                                art that they can show in a movie is wide, they can let people feel every emotion if
                                they can in one movie.
                                Another one is reading, my personality change as time goes by, since grade 1 to gr8, I
                                am introverted person, to the point that I can't look people in the eyes, and that is
                                where my reading hobby comes from.
                                Since i don't want to talk to people, I did try to think any past time that I can do
                                when I am outside, since my older sister have some books/novels, I tried to read them
                                and that is the start of it, and until now
                                it's still one of my past time, and I think it will never leave.
                            </p>

                            it is hard to put the icon to right side with a transition. Supposedly, when you click the read more,
                            my picture will become portrait, shining, but i cannot search anything like that in google to use as reference.
